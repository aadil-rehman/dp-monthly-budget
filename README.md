## LLM Usage Acknowledgment

- The D3.js visualization logic was implemented with the assistance of OpenAI's ChatGPT to guide the integration and chart-building due to lack of prior knwoledge in D3.
- All other code (frontend, backend, styling, routing, authentication, and API logic) was written independently.
